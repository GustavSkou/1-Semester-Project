        spaceQuestion = "Info card:\n One would usually assume that fires are bad for the environment, but they are actually very common and useful in the savanna!\n The fires in Africa's savanna actually comprise the largest proportion of areas burned globally, \n and has made the landscape and animals adapted to it over time.\n One of the main sources of the natural fires throughout history has been lighting, which resulted in patchy and less intense fires.\n These fires occurred during the summer wet season.\n But as humans started to settle and needed the landscape for agriculture,\n the human induced wildfires with high intensity now last for months during its dry season.\n These wildfires lead to high amounts of smoke, which negatively affects the environment by absorbing the sunlight and interacting with clouds which leads to less rainfall.\n\n Question:\n\n Good fires and bad fires occur in the savanna. How do the wildfires contributed to by humans differ from the natural fires in the savanna?";
